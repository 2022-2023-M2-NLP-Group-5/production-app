>*A sandbox dedicated to the S9's project. Here our work can be a bit messy, like a draft.*

> *Just a draft of the readme we need to hand over*


## **Project title**

## Abstract

## Repo's structure

- [`README.md`](/README.md): this file.
- [`articles/`](/articles/): folder containing all the articles read or mentioned in the report, as PDFs. Each file is labled using the template `[article topic]-[publication year]-[authors' last names].pdf`; if more than 3 authors are present, `[authors' last names]` is replaced by `[first author's last name]-et-al` instead. *You can dump all the interesting papers that you find.*
