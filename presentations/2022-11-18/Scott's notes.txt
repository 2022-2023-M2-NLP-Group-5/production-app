going to use mBERT

googl books ngrams dataset is available using script to download
duy suggested using google books/ngram dataset with bert
Duy suggesting we let user choose only language and list of entries (do NOT let them choose time period)
Averie saying this is just a trivial front-end difference
Averie saying we are aiming for/inspired by histwords UI (wordclouds, timelines etc)
tbd scott: tag Duy on pics of histwords on chat
